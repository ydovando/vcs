## Intro
This is the second iteration of the version control system build by Team PSA. The goal of this iteration is to build upon the strong foundation used in the first iteration. As such, the current version of this system now offers users the ability to create a new repository, commit changes to a repository, check-in any changes made from external folders, check-out changes to an external folder, and label manifest files in repositories using unique identifiers. The new product offers a greater user experience in order to interact with the system.
